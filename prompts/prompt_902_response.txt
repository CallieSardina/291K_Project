Let's analyze the steps and identify where the error occurred:

Initial input: 2 5 8 11

1. The first operation was 5 - 2 = 3 (left: 3 8 11).
   - The purpose of this step seems to be to create a smaller number that can be combined with other numbers to reach 24.

2. The second operation was 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 (left: 2.67 11).
   - The goal here appears to be to create a fraction that can be combined with the remaining number (11) to get closer to 24.

3. The third operation was 11 / 2.67 ≈ 4.12 (left: 4.12).
   - This step seems to be an attempt to create another value that, when combined with the remaining number (4.12), can eventually reach 24.

4. The fourth operation was 12 - 4 = 8 (left: 8).
   - At this point, the remaining number is 8, and it's not possible to perform any combination of operations with the other numbers (3, 8, 11) to reach 24.

Now, let's analyze from the fourth step:

- Starting with 8, we can combine it with 3 to reach 24: 8 * 3 = 24.

Therefore, the correct sequence of operations is:

1. 5 - 2 = 3 (left: 3 8 11)
2. 8 * 3 = 24 (left: 24)

So, the correct sequence is sure to reach 24.
