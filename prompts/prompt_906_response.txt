Let's break down the thought process step by step:

1. Initial input: 1 8 10 11.
   - The first operation: 8 - 1 = 7 (left: 7 10 11)
     - Purpose: Attempting to create a smaller number while leaving room for multiplication or division in subsequent steps.

2. The second operation: 11 - 7 = 4 (left: 4 10).
   - Purpose: Continuing to reduce numbers to create an opportunity for multiplication or division.

3. The third operation: 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 6).
   - Purpose: Further simplifying numbers, aiming to create factors of 24 through multiplication or division.

4. The fourth operation: 8 + 6 = 14 (left: 14 14 16).
   - Purpose: Trying to get closer to 24 by addition. However, this step seems to deviate from the goal.

Now, let's analyze the fourth step to identify where the error occurred:
   - The sum (14) is not helpful in reaching 24 directly.
   - The correct operation should focus on multiplication or division to combine numbers in a way that gets closer to 24.

Revised fourth operation: 14 * 1 = 14 (left: 14 16).
   - Purpose: Multiplying by 1 to keep the same result and continue the process.

Now, let's continue from the third step:
   - The third operation: 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 6).
   - Purpose: Still aiming to simplify numbers for better combinations.

Revised third operation: 6 * 2 = 12 (left: 12).
   - Purpose: Multiplying by 2 to create a factor that can be combined with other numbers.

Continue to the second step:
   - The second operation: 11 - 7 = 4 (left: 4 10).
   - Purpose: Continuing to simplify numbers.

Revised second operation: 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 6).
   - Purpose: Further simplifying numbers.

Continue to the first step:
   - The first operation: 8 - 1 = 7 (left: 7 10 11).
   - Purpose: Creating a smaller number.

Revised first operation: 11 - 7 = 4 (left: 4 7 10).
   - Purpose: Continuing to simplify numbers.

Now, we have the sequence of operations:
   1. 11 - 7 = 4
   2. 10 - 4 = 6
   3. 6 * 2 = 12
   4. 14 * 1 = 14

And the result is 14, which is not equal to 24. Therefore, the correct judgment is that it is still impossible to reach 24 with the given numbers (1 8 10 11).
