Certainly, let's analyze the steps and correct the solution:

**Initial Input: 2 5 8 11**

1. **First Operation: 11 - 5 = 6 (left: 2 6 8)**
   - Explanation: I chose 11 and 5 for the first operation because subtracting a smaller number from a larger one could provide a reasonable starting point. The goal is to get closer to 24 by manipulating the numbers.
   - Correction: This step is correct.

2. **Second Operation: 8 / 6 = 1 (left: 2 1)**
   - Explanation: I divided 8 by 6 to simplify the numbers and get rid of one variable, hoping to get closer to the target value.
   - Correction: This is incorrect; I should have multiplied instead of dividing to maintain integers. The correct operation would be 8 * 6 = 48.

3. **Third Operation: (2 * 1) = 2**
   - Explanation: I multiplied the remaining numbers to get the final result.
   - Correction: This step is correct.

The provided incorrect fourth step was 12 - 4 = 8, which is not allowed. Instead, we would proceed from the third step directly to the final result.

**Corrected Sequence of Operations:**
- [Equation 1]: 11 - 5 = 6
- [Equation 2]: 8 * 6 = 48
- [Equation 3]: 2 * 1 = 2

**Reevaluation:**
6 * 48 * 2 = 576, which is not equal to 24. So, this solution is incorrect.

**Further Correction:**
Let's reevaluate the second step, where the mistake occurred.

2. **Second Operation (Corrected): 8 * 6 = 48 (left: 2 48)**
   - Explanation: Multiplying 8 by 6 gives us 48, maintaining integers and providing a larger number for the next step.
   - Correction: This is the corrected operation.

3. **Third Operation: (2 * 48) = 96**
   - Explanation: I multiplied the remaining numbers to get the final result.
   - Correction: This step is correct.

**Updated Corrected Sequence of Operations:**
- [Equation 1]: 11 - 5 = 6
- [Equation 2]: 8 * 6 = 48
- [Equation 3]: 2 * 48 = 96

**Final Evaluation:**
6 * 48 * 96 = 27648, which is not equal to 24. The solution is still incorrect, and further correction is needed.

**Further Correction (Third Equation):**
Let's reevaluate the third step, where the mistake occurred.

3. **Third Operation (Corrected): (48 / 2) = 24**
   - Explanation: I divided 48 by 2 to get the final result of 24.
   - Correction: This is the corrected operation.

**Fully Corrected Sequence of Operations:**
- [Equation 1]: 11 - 5 = 6
- [Equation 2]: 8 * 6 = 48
- [Equation 3]: 48 / 2 = 24

**Final Evaluation:**
6 * 48 / 2 = 144, which is equal to 24. The corrected sequence of operations leads to the correct solution for the game of 24.
