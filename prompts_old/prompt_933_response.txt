Let's review the initial steps and identify where the error occurred:

Initial input: 6 9 9 11

1. The first operation was 9 / 6 = 1.5 (left: 1.5 9 11).
   - The purpose of this step was likely to create a fraction that can be combined with other numbers to reach 24.

2. The second operation was 11 + 1.5 = 12.5 (left: 9 12.5).
   - The goal here seems to be combining the result of the first operation (1.5) with 11 to get a number that can be further manipulated to reach 24.

3. The third operation was 12.5 - 9 = 3.5 (left: 3.5 9).
   - This step appears to be an attempt to create another value that, when combined with the remaining number (9), can eventually reach 24.

4. The fourth operation was 3.5 + 9 = 12.5 (left: 12.5).
   - The aim here seems to be combining the two remaining numbers (3.5 and 9) to get closer to 24.

Now, let's analyze from the fourth step:

- Starting with 12.5, it's not possible to perform any combination of operations with the remaining numbers (3.5 and 9) to reach 24.

- Therefore, let's backtrack to the third step (3.5 9) and explore alternatives.

- Instead of subtracting 9 from 3.5, we can multiply them: 3.5 * 9 = 31.5.

- Now, we have 31.5 as the only remaining number. To reach 24, we can subtract 7.5 (31.5 - 7.5 = 24).

So, the corrected sequence of operations is:

1. 9 / 6 = 1.5 (left: 1.5 9 11)
2. 11 + 1.5 = 12.5 (left: 9 12.5)
3. 3.5 * 9 = 31.5 (left: 31.5)
4. 31.5 - 7.5 = 24

Therefore, the correct sequence is sure to reach 24.
