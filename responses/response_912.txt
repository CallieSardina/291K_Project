Let's review the initial input 4 6 6 9 and the steps taken:

1. **Step 1:** 4 + 6 = 10 (left: 6 9 10)

   - **Explanation:** The goal was likely to create a pair of numbers that could be combined or manipulated to reach 24. However, adding 4 and 6 does not immediately lead to a path to 24.

   - **Correct Operation:** Instead, the correct operation would be subtraction to create the number 2, i.e., 6 - 4 = 2.

2. **Step 2:** 6 + 9 = 15 (left: 10 15)

   - **Explanation:** The intention might have been to create larger numbers for further manipulation. However, adding 6 and 9 does not seem to be useful for reaching 24.

   - **Correct Operation:** The correct operation here would be multiplication to utilize the previously created 2, i.e., 2 * 9 = 18.

3. **Step 3:** 15 / 10 = 1.5 (left: 1.5 10)

   - **Explanation:** The division operation here likely aimed at creating a fraction that could be added to 10 to reach 24. However, this approach does not seem effective.

   - **Correct Operation:** Instead, multiplication would be more suitable, taking advantage of the 18 and 2 obtained earlier, i.e., 18 * 1.5 = 27.

4. **Step 4:** 1.5 + 10 = 11.5 (left: 11.5)

   - **Explanation:** The final operation aimed at reaching 24, but the current result is far from the target.

   - **Correct Operation:** The correct operation would be subtraction, using the 27 obtained earlier, i.e., 27 - 11.5 = 15.5.

Now, let's analyze from Step 4 if we can reach 24:

- **Step 5:** 15.5 + X = 24, where X is the missing number.
  
   - **Correct Operation:** The correct operation here would be addition, i.e., 24 - 15.5 = 8.5.

So, the correct sequence of operations is:

1. 6 - 4 = 2
2. 2 * 9 = 18
3. 18 * 1.5 = 27
4. 27 - 11.5 = 15.5
5. 15.5 + 8.5 = 24

Therefore, the correct solution to reach 24 is 6 - 4 = 2, 2 * 9 = 18, 18 * 1.5 = 27, 27 - 11.5 = 15.5, and 15.5 + 8.5 = 24. The initial judgment of "impossible" was correct, but the specific operations needed adjustment.
