Let's review the steps and identify where the error occurred in reaching the conclusion that it's impossible to reach 24 with the numbers 1, 8, 10, and 11.

Initial numbers: 1 8 10 11

Step 1: 8 - 1 = 7 (left: 7 10 11)

Explanation: I chose the numbers 8 and 1 because subtracting them gives 7, and I wanted to reduce the numbers while aiming for 24. This step is valid.

Step 2: 11 - 7 = 4 (left: 4 10)

Explanation: I subtracted 7 from 11 to get 4, aiming to further reduce the numbers. This step is also valid.

Step 3: 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 6)

Explanation: I subtracted 4 from 10 to get 6, continuing the process of reducing the numbers. This step is valid.

Step 4: 8 + 6 = 14 (left: 14 14 16)

Explanation: I added 8 and 6 to get 14, intending to continue the reduction process. This is where the error occurred.

Review of Step 4:
To correct this step and reach 24, I can perform a different operation. Instead of addition, I should have multiplied the remaining numbers, 14 and 16, to get 224. Then, I can apply the correct operations in the subsequent steps to reach 24.

Corrected Steps:
Step 4 (corrected): 14 * 16 = 224 (left: 14)

Now, I can proceed with the correct sequence of operations:

Step 5: 11 + 1 = 12 (left: 12 224)
Step 6: 10 - 8 = 2 (left: 2 224)
Step 7: 12 * 2 = 24 (left: 24)

The correct sequence of operations to reach 24 is:
11 + 1 = 12
10 - 8 = 2
12 * 2 = 24

This analysis reveals that the error was in the choice of the operation in Step 4. The correct strategy involves carefully selecting operations and considering multiple possibilities to find the correct sequence leading to 24.
