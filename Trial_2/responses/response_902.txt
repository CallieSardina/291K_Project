Certainly! Let's break down the thought process and identify where the error occurred in reaching the solution 24 using the numbers 4, 9, 10, and 13.

Initial input: 4 9 10 13

[Equation 1]:
The first operation was 5 - 2 = 3 (left: 3 8 11).
Explanation: Chose two numbers (5 and 2) that could be subtracted to produce a single-digit result (3) and left two remaining numbers (8 and 11).

[Equation 2]:
The second operation was 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 (left: 2.67 11).
Explanation: Chose two remaining numbers (8 and 3) and performed division to produce a decimal result (2.67). This is where the error occurred, as per the instructions, we should avoid intermediate decimal values.

Correct [Equation 2]:
To avoid decimals, let's change the second operation to multiplication. 8 * 3 = 24 (left: 24 11).

[Equation 3]:
The third operation was 11 / 2.67 ≈ 4.12 (left: 4.12).
Explanation: Chose the remaining two numbers (11 and 2.67) and performed division, resulting in a decimal value.

Correct [Equation 3]:
To avoid decimals, let's change the third operation to division. 24 / 2 = 12 (left: 12).

Now, reevaluating the final step:
The incorrect fourth step was 12 - 4 = 8 (left: 8).
The correct final step is: 48 / 2 = 24.

Correct Sequence of Operations:
[Equation 1]: 5 - 2 = 3
[Equation 2]: 8 * 3 = 24
[Equation 3]: 48 / 2 = 24

Now, evaluate whether this new response correctly evaluates to 24:
3 (Equation 1) * 24 (Equation 2) / 12 (Equation 3) = 3 * 24 / 12 = 72 / 12 = 24

The new sequence of operations correctly evaluates to 24.
