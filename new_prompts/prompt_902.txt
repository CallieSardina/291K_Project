You were previously given the following instructions: 
                Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. 
                At each subsequent step, you were prompted to evaluate if given numbers can reach 24 (sure/likely/impossible).
                At the final step, you were given an input and an answer and instructed to give a judgement (sure/impossible) if the answer is correct, 
                i.e. it uses each input exactly once and no other numbers, and reach 24.

                Given the numbers 2 5 8 11, your initial output was that it is impossible to reach 24. 
                Let's explore the thought process and identify where the error occurred. Break down your solution into individual steps, 
                explaining the reasoning behind each operation.

                Tree of Thought:

                Start by reviewing the initial input 2 5 8 11.
                The first operation you used was 5 - 2 = 3 (left: 3 8 11) 
                Explain the first operation performed and its purpose. 
                That is, explain why you chose these numbers and corresponding operation to start with as opposed to any other combination.
                If an error occurred in the first step, identify the correct operation that should have been chosen.
                Continue this process step by step until the incorrect output is reached.
                The second operation you used was 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 (left: 2.67 11).
                The third operation you used was 11 / 2.67 ≈ 4.12 (left: 4.12).
                The fourth operation you used was 12 - 4 = 8 (left: 8). 
                Start from the fourth step, and determine if you could change this step to reach a correct solutions resulting in 24.
                If not, repeat this analysis for the third step, second step, and first step as necessry.
                For each step, provide the correct operation and the correct subsequent operations and result.
                Conclude by summarizing the correct sequence of operations that lead to the correct solution for the game of 24.
                
                Evaluate whether your new response correctly evaluates to 24. If it does not, review the following: 
For reference in the analysis of where the error occurred, 
                        I have provided the correct sequence of operations to reach 24 is listed below. 
                        If there are multiple possible solution paths, these are delimited by '***'.

                        and report why you made the error you did. Explore properties of the numbers and equations,
                        why your decision making process was faulty, and how it could be improved. 
                        Report your new answer in the form: 
                        [Equation 1]
                        [Equation 2]
                        [Equation 3]
                        Furthermore, please use this information to generate a general strategy for solving the game of 24.
11 - 5 = 6
6 * 8 = 48
48 / 2 = 24

11 + 5 = 16
16 * 2 = 32
32 - 8 = 24
