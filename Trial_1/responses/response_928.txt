Certainly, let's go through the thought process step by step:

Initial Input: 4 7 9 13

First Operation: 7 - 4 = 3 (left: 3 9 13)
- The purpose here is to create a smaller number to work with and use the subtraction operation to achieve this. Starting with the smallest numbers is often a good strategy.

Second Operation: 9 / 3 = 3 (left: 3 13)
- The idea is to simplify the numbers further, and division is used to achieve this. Again, the goal is to keep reducing the numbers gradually.

Third Operation: 3 * 13 = 39 (left: 39)
- At this point, there is only one operation left, multiplication. The aim is to combine the remaining numbers to get as close as possible to 24. However, the result here is 39, not 24.

Mistake Analysis:
- The mistake occurred in the third operation where the multiplication resulted in 39 instead of 24. To fix this, we need to reevaluate the numbers and operations.

Revised Third Operation: 39 / 3 = 13 (left: 13)
- Instead of multiplication, division can be used to reach the correct result. Dividing 39 by 3 gives 13, and we're left with the number 13.

Now, let's create the correct sequence of operations:

[Equation 1]: 7 - 4 = 3
[Equation 2]: 9 / 3 = 3
[Equation 3]: 39 / 3 = 13

Evaluate whether the new response correctly evaluates to 24:
3 * 3 * 13 = 117

Since the result is not 24, let's revise the sequence:

Revised Third Operation: 13 * 2 = 26 (left: 26)
- We can use multiplication instead of division to get closer to 24.

Now, the correct sequence of operations is:

[Equation 1]: 7 - 4 = 3
[Equation 2]: 9 / 3 = 3
[Equation 3]: 13 * 2 = 26

Evaluate whether the new response correctly evaluates to 24:
3 * 3 * 26 = 234

The result is still not 24. It seems there is an issue with the initial approach, and the numbers provided may not lead to a solution that evaluates to 24 using only three equations.
