Let's break down the thought process step by step:

**Initial Input: 1 8 10 11**

**Step 1: 8 - 1 = 7 (left: 7 10 11)**

In the first step, I chose to subtract 1 from 8 to get 7. The purpose was to simplify the numbers and work with smaller values, making it easier to reach 24. The remaining numbers were 7, 10, and 11.

**Step 2: 11 - 7 = 4 (left: 4 10)**

In the second step, I subtracted 7 from 11 to get 4. Again, the goal was to simplify the numbers further. The remaining numbers were 4 and 10.

**Step 3: 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 6)**

Next, I subtracted 4 from 10 to get 6, further simplifying the numbers.

**Step 4: 8 + 6 = 14 (left: 14 14 16)**

Now, I added 6 to 8, resulting in 14. At this point, I made an error. Instead of reaching 24, the numbers left were 14, 14, and 16.

The mistake occurred in Step 4. To correct this, I should have chosen a different operation in Step 4 to get the desired result of 24. Let's explore an alternative:

**Corrected Step 4: 14 * (16 / 14) = 16 (left: 16)**

By multiplying 14 by the result of (16 / 14), I can reach 16. This leaves only one number, 16.

Now, I need to find a way to combine the remaining numbers to get 24. Let's perform another multiplication:

**Step 5: 16 * (1 + 10) = 16 * 11 = 176**

Unfortunately, this doesn't result in 24. Let's backtrack to Step 3 and try a different approach:

**Alternative Step 3: 10 / (4 - 6) = -5**

This approach also doesn't lead to 24. Let's go further back to Step 2:

**Alternative Step 2: 11 - (4 + 10) = -3**

This approach also fails to reach 24. The issue seems to stem from Step 1, where I initially subtracted 1 from 8. Let's reconsider this step:

**Alternative Step 1: 10 - (11 - 8) = 7**

This doesn't yield 24 either. It appears that the initial numbers and operations chosen don't lead to the desired result.

**Correct Sequence of Operations:**

It seems that, given the numbers 1, 8, 10, and 11, it is indeed impossible to reach 24 using three equations with basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /).

Therefore, the corrected evaluation is: **Impossible**.
