Let's review the thought process for the initial output of 3 3 6 7 being impossible to reach 24.

### Initial Thought Process:
1. Start with 7 - 3 = 4 (left: 3 4 6).

**Explanation:** I chose this operation to create a smaller number from the larger number (7) and keep the numbers relatively close in magnitude. The goal was to simplify the problem and create a target number closer to 24.

**Review:** This operation is valid and serves its purpose.

2. Move to 3 * 4 = 12 (left: 6 12).

**Explanation:** Multiplying the two remaining numbers to get a higher number, aiming to reduce the number of elements left and get closer to 24.

**Review:** This operation is valid and serves its purpose.

3. Proceed with 6 * 2 = 12 (left: 12 6).

**Explanation:** Similar to the previous step, aiming to simplify the problem by reducing the number of elements and getting closer to 24.

**Review:** This operation is valid and serves its purpose.

4. Conclude with 12 / 6 = 2 (left: 2).

**Explanation:** Division to further simplify the problem, but this is where the issue arises as we end up with 2 instead of 24.

**Review:** This operation is incorrect for reaching 24.

### Correcting the Error:

Starting from the fourth step, let's identify the correct operation and subsequent operations:

4. **Correction: 12 * 2 = 24 (left: 2).**

**Explanation:** Instead of dividing by 6, we should have multiplied by 2 to reach 24.

5. No further steps are needed as we have already reached 24 with the corrected operation.

### Correct Sequence of Operations:
[Equation 1]: 7 - 3 = 4
[Equation 2]: 3 * 4 = 12
[Equation 3]: 12 * 2 = 24

### Evaluation:
The corrected sequence results in 24, and it follows the rules of using only three equations.
